I need to update my email address. I want to know if I'll lose access to my account if I change it. I've added quite a few products to my cart and don't want to look for them again.

It would be great to continue using this account with my new email address. Please let me know if that's possible.

Regards,
Emily Garcia","Hi Emily,    The good news is that you will not lose the items in your cart when you change your email address.
